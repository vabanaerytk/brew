        `upgrade` [<options>] [<formula>]

        Upgrade outdated, unpinned formulae using the same options they were originally
        installed with, plus any appended brew formula options. If <formula> are specified,
        upgrade only the given <formula> kegs (unless they are pinned; see `pin`, `unpin`).

        Unless `HOMEBREW_NO_INSTALL_CLEANUP` is set, `brew cleanup` will then be run for the
        upgraded formulae or, every 30 days, for all formulae.
